You are given an array of logs. Each log is a space-delimited string of words, where the first word is the identifier.
There are two types of logs:
Letter-logs: All words (except the identifier) consist of lowercase English letters.
Digit-logs: All words (except the identifier) consist of digits.
Reorder these logs so that:
The letter-logs come before all digit-logs.
The letter-logs are sorted lexicographically by their contents. If their contents are the same, then sort them lexicographically by their identifiers.
The digit-logs maintain their relative ordering.
Return the final order of the logs.
Example 1
Input: logs = ["dig1 8 1 5 1","let1 art can","dig2 3 6","let2 own kit dig","let3 art zero"]
Output: ["let1 art can","let3 art zero","let2 own kit dig","dig1 8 1 5 1","dig2 3 6"]
Explanation:
The letter-log contents are all different, so their ordering is "art can", "art zero", "own kit dig".
The digit-logs have a relative order of "dig1 8 1 5 1", "dig2 3 6".
Example 2:
Input: logs = ["a1 9 2 3 1","g1 act car","zo4 4 7","ab1 off key dog","a8 act zoo"]
Output: ["g1 act car","a8 act zoo","ab1 off key dog","a1 9 2 3 1","zo4 4 7"]
